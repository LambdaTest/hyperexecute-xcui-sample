HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end XCUI tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# How to run XCUI tests on HyperExecute

* [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
   - [Download HyperExecute CLI](#download-hyperexecute-cli)
   - [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables)

* [Configure YAML File](#configure-yaml-in-your-test-suite)
* [Execute your Test Suite](#execute-your-test-suite)
* [Navigation in Automation Dashboard](#navigation-in-automation-dashboard)

## Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

### Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

### Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Configure YAML in your Test Suite

Enter your relative app and test suite path for the `appPath` and `testSuitePath` flags in the YAML file. This YAML file is present in the root directory of this sample repository.

```bash
---
version: "0.2"

runson: ios

autosplit: true

concurrency: 1

retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2

framework:
  name: "ios/xcui"
  args:

    appPath: LambdaUiKitIOS.ipa #enter your relative app path

    testSuitePath: ProverbialTest.ipa #enter your relative test suite path
    video: true
    filters:
      attributes:
      - type: className
        values: ["LambdaUiKitIOSUITestsLaunchTests"]
      - type: testName
        values: ["LambdaUiKitIOSUITests/testverifyAppLaunch"]
    deviceSelectionStrategy: any
    devices: [".*"]

jobLabel: ['HyperExecute', 'XCUI', 'Real Device']
```

## Execute your Test Suite

NOTE: In case of macOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config <path_of_yaml_file>
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <path_of_yaml_file>
```

e.g.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user user1 --key 12345 --config hyperexecute-xcui.yaml
```


## Navigation in Automation Dashboard

HyperExecute lets you navigate from/to *Test Logs* in Automation Dashboard from/to *HyperExecute Logs*. You also get relevant get relevant XCUI test details like video, network log, commands, Exceptions & more in the Dashboard. Effortlessly navigate from the automation dashboard to HyperExecute logs (and vice-versa) to get more details of the test execution.
