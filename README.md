HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end Selenium tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Configure YAML in your Test Suite

Enter your `<RELATIVE_APP_PATH>` and `<RELATIVE_TEST_SUITE_PATH>` in the YAML file

```bash
---
version: "0.2"

runson: ios

autosplit: true

concurrency: 1

retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2

framework:
  name: "ios/xcui"
  args:
  # highlight-next-line
    appPath: <RELATIVE_APP_PATH>
    # highlight-next-line
    testSuitePath: <RELATIVE_TEST_SUITE_PATH>
    video: true
    filters:
      attributes:
      - type: className
        values: ["LambdaUiKitIOSUITestsLaunchTests"]
      - type: testName
        values: ["LambdaUiKitIOSUITests/testverifyAppLaunch"]
    deviceSelectionStrategy: any
    devices: [".*"]

jobLabel: ['HyperExecute', 'XCUI', 'Real Device']
```

:::tip
You can also upload your **application** to the LambdaTest servers using our <b>REST API</b>. You need to provide your <b>Username</b> and <b>AccessKey</b> in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the <b>cURL</b> command for authentication.

Enter your local path of the code repository instead of `<YOUR_LOCAL_APP_PATH>` in the below cURL command.

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
<CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"<YOUR_LOCAL_APP_PATH>"" -F "name="sampleApp""
`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

Enter your `<APP_ID>` in the YAML file in the `framework` flag:

```bash
appId: lt://<APP_ID>
```
